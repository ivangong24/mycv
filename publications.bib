   abstract = {Background: Paraquat dichloride is currently among the most widely used commercial herbicides in the USA. In the present study, we provide epidemiological assessment of ambient paraquat exposure and Parkinson's disease (PD) risk in a population-based study of PD in agricultural regions of Central California. Methods: Based on 829 PD patients and 824 community controls, we assessed associations between ambient paraquat dichloride exposure and PD. We estimated residential and workplace proximity to commercial agricultural applications in three California counties since 1974 using the CA pesticide use reporting (PUR) data and land use maps. We evaluated any, duration and average intensity [pounds (0.45 kilograms) per acre per year] of exposure for paraquat in four time windows. Results: Ambient paraquat exposure assessed at both residence and workplace was associated with PD, based on several different exposure measures. The PD patients both lived and worked near agricultural facilities applying greater amounts of the herbicide than community controls. For workplace proximity to commercial applications since 1974, working near paraquat applications every year in the window [odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ 1.46, 3.19] and a higher average intensity of exposure [per 10 pounds (4.54 kilograms), OR ¼ 2.08, 95% CI ¼ 1.31, 3.38] were both associated with an increased odds of PD. Similar associations were observed for residential proximity (duration: OR ¼ 1.91, 95% CI ¼ 1.30, 2.83; average intensity: OR ¼ 1.72, 95% CI ¼ 0.99, 3.04). Risk estimates were comparable for men and women, and the strongest odds were observed for those diagnosed at 60 years of age. Conclusion: This study provides further indication that paraquat dichloride exposure increases the risk of Parkinson's disease.},

   abstract = {Background: Pesticide exposure has consistently been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) onset. Yet, fewer epidemiologic studies have examined whether pesticides influence PD motor and non-motor symptom progression. Objectives: Using a geographic information system tool that integrates agricultural pesticide use reports and land use records to derive ambient exposures at residences and workplaces, we assessed associations between specific pesticides previously related to PD onset with PD symptom progression in two PD patient cohorts living in agricultural regions of California. Methods: We calculated the pounds of pesticide applied agriculturally near each participant's residential or occupational addresses from 1974 to the year of PD diagnosis, using a geographic information system tool that links the California Pesticide Use Reports database to land use data. We examined 53 pesticides selected a priori as they have previously been associated with PD onset. We longitudinally followed two PD patient cohorts (PEG1 N = 242, PEG2 N = 259) for an average of 5.0 years (SD ± 3.5) and 2.7 years (SD ± 1.6) respectively and assessed PD symptoms using the movement disorder specialist-administered Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Weighted time-to-event regression models were implemented to estimate effects. Results: Ten agricultural pesticides, including copper sulfate (pentahydrate), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) dimethylamine salt, tribufos, sodium cacodylate, methamidophos, ethephon, propargite, bromoxynil octanoate, monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA), and dicamba, were associated with faster symptom progression. Among these pesticides, residential or workplace proximity to higher amounts of copper sulfate (pentahydrate) and MCPA (dimethylamine salt) was associated with all three progression endpoints (copper sulfate: HRs = 1.22–1.36, 95 % CIs = 1.03–1.73; MCPA: HRs = 1.27–1.35, 95 % CIs = 1.02–1.70). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure may not only be relevant for PD onset but also PD progression phenotypes. We have implicated ten specific pesticide active ingredients in faster PD motor and non-motor decline.},

   abstract = {Real-world data on lipid levels and treatment among adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) are relatively limited. We studied lipid levels and treatment status in patients with DM across cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk groups and sociodemographic factors. In the All of Us Research Program, we categorized DM as (1) moderate risk (≤1 CVD risk factor), (2) high risk (≥2 CVD risk factors), and (3) DM with atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We examined the use of statin and non-statin therapy as well as LDL-C and triglyceride levels. We studied 81,332 participants with DM, which included 22.3% non-Hispanic Black and 17.2% Hispanic. A total of 31.1% had ≤1 DM risk factor, 30.3% had ≥2 DM risk factors, and 38.6% of participants had DM with ASCVD. Only 18.2% of those with DM and ASCVD were on high-intensity statins. Overall, 5.1% were using ezetimibe and 0.6% PCSK9 inhibitors. Among those with DM and ASCVD, only 21.1% had LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. Overall, 1.9% of participants with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL were on icosapent ethyl. Those with DM and ASCVD were more likely to be on high-intensity statins, ezetimibe, and icosapent ethyl. Guideline-recommended use of high-intensity statins and non-statin therapy among our higher risk DM patients is lacking, with LDL-C inadequately controlled.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Data are limited on sodium glucose co-transport 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) among real-world cohorts of underrepresented patients. We examined these therapies and glycemic control in US adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and sociodemographic factors. Methods: In the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative All of Us Research Program, we categorized DM as (1) moderate risk, (2) high risk, and (3) with ASCVD. We examined proportions on DM therapies, including SGLT2-i or GLP-1 RA, and at glycemic control by sociodemographic factors and CVD risk groups. Results: Our 81,332 adults aged ≥ 18 years with DM across 340 US sites included 22.3% non-Hispanic Black, 17.2% Hispanic, and 1.8% Asian participants; 31.1%, 30.3%, and 38.6% were at moderate risk, high risk, or with ASCVD, respectively. Those with DM and ASCVD were most likely on SGLT2-i (8.6%) or GLP-1 RA (11.9%). SGLT2-i use was < 10% in those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease. The odds (95% CI) of SGLT2-i use were greater among men (1.35 [1.20, 1.53]) and Asian persons (2.31 [1.78, 2.96]), with GLP-1 RA being less common (0.78 [0.70, 0.86]) in men. GLP-1 RA use was greater among those with health insurance, and both GLP-1 RA and SGLT2-i greater within lower income groups. 72.0% of participants had HbA1c < 7%; Hispanic persons were least likely at glycemic control. Conclusions: Treatment with SGLT2-is and GLP-1 RAs remains low, even among higher ASCVD risk persons with DM and use is even lower among underserved groups.},
